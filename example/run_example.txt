Example of running XookSuut on a simulated velocity map with an oval distortion.

#Goal:
Recover the different kinemaitc components from each kinematic model

#Data:
This example simulates a velocity map recovered from a second moment map such as those obtained from IFS-data, FP, HI etc.
Velocity map units are in those required by XS, i.e., km/s.
The pixel size of the example file is 1 arcsec*pixel**-1
No error map is passed 

 

#Setup,
In this example we will estimate the rotation curves in raddi equali spaced.
The starting ring will be placed at 2 arcsec and subsequent rings will be placed each 1.5 arcsec.
The maximum radius will be placed up to 40 arcsec (on the disk plane).
- Velocities will be computed in each ring only if rings contain at least 1/3 of the total pixels.
- Noncircular motions describing the bar distortion will be computed up to 20arcsec
- It will be used the Levenbergâ€“Marquardt (LM) for the least-square analysis
	- 5 Itereations will be used for evaluating the chisquare.
		!NOTE At least 2 iteration is required to stibilize the disk-geometry.!

- PA[deg] = 50, INC[deg] = 60, XC[pixels] = 38, YC[pixels] = 38 are the initial guess values for the disk geometry.
	All parameters are allowed to vary during the fitting (i.e, VARY_PARAM = 1)
- The systemic velocity [km/s] guess is estimated around the kinematic centre (XC,YC)

# XS configuration file
##


If you want to acces to the superior configuration of XookSuut you will have to pass a configuration file in the command line.
By default XS ALWAYS uses the config file stored in ./src/xs_config.ini, where all variables are deactivated by default. 
It is highly recomended that you copy the xs_config.ini file in your working directory and edit it according to your own preference.

In the configuration file you can access to the MCMC analysis, bootstrap errors, and general parameters.

#####
# XookSuut adopting MCMC methods
#####

In order to acces to the MCMC analysis, you will have to edit the configuration file. In this example we have copied the ./src/xs_config.ini file
to this directory and renamed as xs_conf.example.ini.
To perform the MCMC analysis we set `mcmc_ana = True`, `sampler = emcee`, `Nsteps = 1000`, in real data you may want to run a couple of thousands;
we will choose a Gaussian posterior distribution `PropDist = G`, and discard 1/3 of the total steps `burnin = 0.333`.
After saving the configuration file we pass it to XS in command line as follows:

# For running a circular model using MCMC:
In a terminal type the following
XookSuut example velmap0_example.fits.gz - 1 50 60 38 38 - 1 1 1 1 1 1.5 - 2,40 1/3. circular LM 5 - xs_conf.example.ini
# For running a bisymmetric model using MCMC:
In a terminal type the following
XookSuut example velmap0_example.fits.gz - 1 50 60 38 38 - 1 1 1 1 1 1.5 - 2,40 1/3. bisymmetric LM 5 20 xs_conf.example.ini

Note 1:
	We can run the same configurations with zeus by changing `sampler = zeus`.
Note 2:
	For using Nested sampling change to `sampler = dynesty`.	

#####
# XookSuut estimation of errors with bootstrap
#####
For this purpose you will have to change active the variable `boots_ana = True` in the configuration file. In addition
the user will have to specify the number of bootstrap iterations with the variable `Nboots`.
Note 1:
	If bootstrap analysis will be used for errors computation make sure `mcmc_ana = False`. Otherwise XS will run the mcmc
	analysis then perform bootstrap.
